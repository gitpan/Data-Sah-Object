NAME
    Data::Sah::Object - Object-oriented interface for Sah schemas

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Data::Sah::Object (from Perl
    distribution Data-Sah-Object), released on 2014-07-28.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Sah::Object; # automatically exports sah(), sahn()

     # sah() creates a normalized copy of schema
     $osch = sah("array*");
     $osch = sah(['array*', of => 'str*']);

     # sahn() assumes you're passing an already-normalized schema and it will not
     # create a copy
     my $osch = sahn([array => {req=>1, of=>'str*'}, {}]);

     say $osch->type; # -> array
     say $osch->clause('req'); # -> 1
     say $osch->clause('of', 'int'); # set clause

DESCRIPTION
    Sah works using pure data structures, but sometimes it's convenient to
    have an object-oriented interface (wrapper) for those data. This module
    provides just that.

FUNCTIONS
  sah $sch => OBJECT
    Exported by default. A shortcut for
    Data::Sah::Object::Schema->new($sch).

  sahn $sch => OBJECT
    Exported by default. A shortcut for Data::Sah::Object::Schema->new($sch,
    1).

SEE ALSO
    Sah, Data::Sah
